# SimonGame
The full game of Simon implemented in Assembly and RISC-V including Documentation.

Implemented a game of Simon using assembly RISC-V language, where the player must follow a randomly generated pattern shown on the display correctly. 

The game also has an extra optional feature that increases the size of the pattern by 1 to raise the difficulty.

The game can detect input from the D-pad to compare it to the correct pattern and display the error and success screens.
